# PGA Tour Machine Learning Project
This repository contains the project for the course Machine Learning at Aalto University. In this project I am trying to predict the finalists of the PGA Tour FedEx Cup playoffs by using different classification methods. The prediction is done using the players' tee shot statistics. The data is gathered from the official website of PGA Tour. The project report (*coming soon*) contains more comprehensive information about the project. The project folder contains the Python code that was used to get the results in the project report.
